# ✨ Hey, I'm Anushka Sambare

💡 Computer science grad who loves turning raw data into *something real* — dashboards that talk back, visuals that spark questions, and stories that numbers alone can’t tell.

🛠 **I build:**  
- Dashboards where KPIs aren’t just numbers, they’re *starting points for curiosity*
- Analytics reports that help business users ask “what if?” — and see answers instantly
- Tools that translate between data, code, and human decisions

🔧 **My data & code toolkit:**  
Power BI · Tableau · Python · SQL · Excel · DAX · Java · PHP · HTML/CSS/JS · MySQL · MongoDB · Git

🌱 **Belief:**  
Good analysis doesn’t live in spreadsheets — it lives in *decisions people actually make*.
